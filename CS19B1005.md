# LLVM
LLVM is a low level virtual machine which is a compiler that convert instructions into a form that can be read and executed by a computer.

## C++ 11 features || c++ 14 features
### 1.AUTO
This keyword declare objects without specifying their types
#### Ex: 
auto PAC = PA.getChecker();

### 2.Lambda expressions
A lambda expression is a mechanism for specifying a function object.In c++11 we have to specify the datatype of x and y whereas in C++14 we can use auto.
#### Ex: 
auto lambda = [](int x, int y) {return x + y;};

### 3.Nullptr
A null pointer is a pointer that doesn't point to any memory location
#### Ex:
DocNode *MapEntry = nullptr;

### 4.Move
Moving the object instead of copying it
#### Ex: 
handleAllErrors(std::move(Err),[&Infos](std::unique_ptr Info) {Infos.emplace_back(std::move(Info)); });

### 5.Range based for loops
Use of auto in for loops
#### Ex:
for (auto &AA : AAs)AA->setAAResults(nullptr);

### 6.Sharedptr
A smart pointer that retains shared ownership of an object through a pointer,to represent shared ownership.
#### Ex:
std::vector<std::shared_ptr> Infos;

### 7.Uniform and general initialization using {} -lists
#### Ex:
Vector(std::initializer_list < double >);

### 8. Deprecated Features
Generation of the copy constructor and the copy assignment is deprecated for a class with a destructor

### 9.Unique_ptr
It is a smart pointer that owns and manages another object through a pointer and disposes of that object when the unique_ptr goes out of scope



## Class Hierarchies

### Single Inheritance
 One derived class can inherit  from only one base class.
 #### Ex:
 In the following link https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/IR/InlineAsm.h </br>
  InlineAsm is derived class and value is base class.Hence it is Single inheritance
 
### Multiple Inheritance
A  derived class can inherit  from more than one base class.

### Multilevel Inheritance
A derived class inherits property from another derived class.
#### Ex:
In the following link:https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/IR/GlobalAlias.h
GlobalIndirectSymbol and ilist_node are derived classes,GlobalAlias isderived class.Since derived class is inherited from more than one derived.It is multilevel inheritance


###  Hierarchical Inheritance
The feature of the base class is inherited onto more than one sub-class.The properties of the base class are derived for derived classes.Access specifier can be private, protected or public.
#### Ex:
In the following link:https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/lib/Linker/LinkDiagnosticInfo.h</br>
DiagnosticInfo is the base class,LinkDiagnosticInfo is derived from base class.Diagnosticinfo is in directory (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/IR/DiagnosticInfo.h) . In this file DiagnosticInfo class is inherited to more than one sub-class.Hence it comes under hierarchical inheritance.

### Explicit Overloading
A function in a derived class overrides a virtual function in a base class if that function has exactly the same name and type

## OOP design decisions for LLVM

### Encapsulation:
We will try to hide the data and complexicity using classes.This concept is used in llvm everywhere where they define a class

### Abstraction:
It displays only essential information.Like we declare which access specifier we do want.

### Polymorphism:
It occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance.We have seen different types of  inheritance above and hierarchy of classes.
#### Ex:Use of virtual functions
In the following link https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/IR/AssemblyAnnotationWriter.h Virtual functions are being used.This depicts polymorphism.

## Design Patterns

1.Usage of templates.</br>
2.Usage of virtual functions.</br>
3.Usage of auto,inline.</br>
4.Usage of oops concepts like polymorphism,encapsulation,data abstarction.</br>
5.Usage of constexpr</br>
6.Usage of static,const keywors </br>
7.Usage of constructors and destructors.

## Usage of iterators and their own data structures
Generally we use auto as keyword for iterators
### regex iterator
We use regex iterator for iterating over a string finding matches for the pattern.This method returns an iterator type to iterate over different matches of a same regex pattern in a sequence.It is a BiDirectionalIterator which means it can move in both the directions
### List Iterator
We use list iterator to transverse through the list.Inserting or deleting any element through the list.It is a BiDirectionalIterator which means it can move in both the directions
### Vector Iterator
We use vector iterator to transverse through the vector.It is a random access iterator which means it can randomly access any element inside the container.</br>
 Ex:</br>
 ```
 for (vector<int>::iterator itr = numbers.begin(); itr != numbers.end(); ++itr) {</br>
    cout << *itr << " "; </br>
}
```
### Const Iterator
A const iterator is used only for displaying but not for changing.
### Map iterator
Ex:
Let us assume that there is a map from int to int.i.e every int value is mapped to an int value.
```unique poin
std::map<int,int> m;</br>
for (std::map<int,int>::iterator i=m.begin(); i!=m.end(); ++i)</br>
    std::cout << i->first << " => " << i->second << '\n';</br>
```
 Here i->first prints the first int and i->second prints the mapped int.It is a bidirectional iterator.
